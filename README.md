# NETFLIX--Data-analysis-and-visualisation-

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Netflix datasets, applying data preprocessing techniques, and uncovering valuable insights. The dataset contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including details like ratings, genres, and release dates.

# Project Overview
Data Preprocessing: Utilized NumPy and Pandas for cleaning and transforming the data, including handling missing values, data type conversions, and feature engineering.
Data Visualization: Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create informative visualizations, including distribution plots, correlation heatmaps, and bar charts to represent various insights from the data.
# Key Features:
Cleaning and preprocessing of Netflix data for analysis.
Data visualizations highlighting trends, patterns, and relationships in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the content distribution, release patterns, and viewer preferences.
# Libraries Used:
1. NumPy
2. Pandas
3.Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
